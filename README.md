The Code uses the  data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Files used are:
From train directory:
X-train.txt
Y_train.txt
Subject_train.txt

From test directory:
X-test.txt
Y_test.txt
Subject_test.txt

Features.txt and activity_labels from main directory

The above .txt files are read using read.table. The labels from feature.txt are added as header to X_test.txt and X_train.txt files.
Y_Train and Y_Test contain activity information for each subject. Using activity label I name the activities in Y_Train and Y_Test.
Activity,Activity label and subject variables are added to X_test and X_train files.

I then merge X_test and X_train files using rbind and call it final_Data

To Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation, I use grep to extract only those variable names from feature.txt
which contains mean() and std(). I then subset final_data using this variable list generated by grep command.

The file generated contains 69 columns(Subject,Activity,Activity label and 66 (std() mean())variables)
